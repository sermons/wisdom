I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. <br>

And I applied my heart to seek and to search out <br>

When Solomon was old his **wives** <br>
**turned away** his heart after other gods, <br>
and his heart was not **wholly true** to the Lord his God

So Solomon did what was **evil** in the sight of the Lord <br>
and did **not** wholly follow the Lord, <br>
as **David** his father had done.
